Run the code from the movie_play_list.py

The code is supposed to scrap the IMDB website of title and description of movies and save them in a .csv file and after that the boot access the file and give you suggestion movies searching by Gender. 

I was updating the code also with a new button that will save the movies that you like after the suggestion in a excel file called my_favorites.xlsx
